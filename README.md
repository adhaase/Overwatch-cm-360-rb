# Overwatch-cm-360-rb
A Ruby variation of my JS Overwatch cm/360 web app.


This is a quick single file implementation of my Overwatch conversion program - primarily for learning Ruby.
The end version will be split up appropriately into multiple files/functions, instead of being condensed into one file and hopefully be decent Ruby code!
