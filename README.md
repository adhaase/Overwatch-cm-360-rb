# Overwatch App: cm/360Â° converter and sensitivity equalizer (Ruby version) ![icons8-ruby-programming-language-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9776844/41577930-9e582fb0-735d-11e8-965d-9ac5175503cb.png)

A Ruby variation of my JS Overwatch cm/360 web app.

This is a Ruby implementation of my Overwatch conversion program - primarily for learning Ruby. 
Therefore there will probably be an excessive amount of comments in this version, and most likely some poor Ruby coding practices. I hope to fix all of those in future Ruby projects, and clean this code up after I learn more!
